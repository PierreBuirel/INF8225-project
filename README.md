# INF8225-project

Authors : BEISEL Julien, BUIREL Pierre, DISSLER Nina, SPRINGUEL Eric

Project made during the INF8225 Machine Learning class 

We're trying to use transfer learning techniques in order to use pretrained models or to train our own models from scratch and re-use mose of the parameters.

1st experiments : use of pretrained torchvision models on ImageNet dataset for Cifar-10 dataset

It didn't work well on the lab computers. Even the smallest network available (squeezenet) didn't run well so we had to change our approach.

2nd experiments : use of our own trained from scratch model on Cifar-10 dataset for Cifar-100 dataset
